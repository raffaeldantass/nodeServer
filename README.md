## Node Server using GraphQL
This is my First Node Server created using GraphQL to work with some login form build with ReactJS

The purpose here is to learn some basic skill with Node, GraphQL, ReactJS. 
<br>
This project was created following the tutorial from [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad) in Youtube, here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqk30IVeYak&list=PLN3n1USn4xlnXfLBuSMFcYM5yei4oxdxB)
